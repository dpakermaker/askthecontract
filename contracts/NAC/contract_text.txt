Trip Trade) in Open Time, he shall not be credited for the PCH from such 
Assignment that was not performed.  EXAMPLE:  A pilot picks up a five 
(5) PCH Trip Pairing and subsequently does not fly two (2) PCH of the 
Trip due to illness.  The Pilot shall be credited only three (3) PCH and his 
Line value shall also increase three (3) PCH.   
 
b.  If Assignment was part of a Trip Trade with an Assignment(s) from Open 
Time, he shall not be credited for th e lesser of the PCH that was not 
performed or if the Trip Trade increased his Line value, the differential 
PCH between his original Assignment(s) and the Assignment(s) from 
Open Time. EXAMPLE: A Pilot trades two (2) of his Assignments in his 
Line for three  (3) Assignments in Open Time. The net effect of the trade 
was an increase in his Line value of ten (10) PCH. Subsequently, the 
Pilot does not perform one , of a portion of the three (3) Assignments that 
were part of the Trip Trade. The PCH value for the As signment that was 
not performed is f ive (5) PCH. The net result from not performing a 
portion of his Assignment (Sick Leave usage): his Line PCH shall only 
be increased five (5) PCH, due to the increased PCH from the Trip Trade.   
 
c.  If the Assignment that was part of a Trip Trade and the PCH from the 
portion of the Assignment that was not performed exceeded the PCH 
increase in his Line value, as provided in subsection 3.P.2.b., the excess 
PCH in a Pilot’s Line shall  be protected by using  Sick Days from his Sick 
Bank, as provided in subsect ion 3.J.1. EXAMPLE: Using the example 
above in subsection 3.P.2.b., the differential PCH from the Trip Trade 
increased his Line Value by ten (10) PCH and he picked up three (3) 
Assignments and traded away into Open Time two (2) Assignments from 
his Line. T he PCH value of the three (3) Assignments that the Pilot 
received were: Assignment #1: twelve (12) PCH, Assignment #2: Six (6) 
PCH and Assignment #3: four (4) PCH. The Pilot does not perform 
Assignment #1, which is a two  (2) Day Trip Pairing and Assignment  #2, 
which is a one (1) Day Trip Pairing. The total PCH lost due to the Pilot ’s 
use of Sick Leave is 12+6 or 18 PCH. The net result of the three (3) Days 
of Sick Leave use is: The Pilot shall not be credited for the Ten (10) PCH 
increase that resulted from  the Trip Trade and he shall use three (3) Sick 
Days from his Sick Bank to protect the remaining eight (8) PCH.   
 
d.  If the Assignment was part of a Trip Trade that caused his Line PCH to 
decrease or stay the same, any  PCH lost due to the Pilot’s use of Sick 
Leave shall be protected by Sick Days in his Sick Bank, as provided in 
subsection 3.J.1., to the extent of available Sick Days in his Sick Bank.  
EXAMPLE: Using the same example above in subsection 3.P.2.c., with 
the exception that we’ll say the Trip Trade caused the Pilot’s Line PCH 
to decrease by one (1) PCH. The Pilot’s first Trip in the Month that he did 
not perform is Assignment #1 (2 - Day Trip with a scheduled PCH of 12 
PCH) and the Second Trip Pairing  that is  not Performed in the Month is DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 57 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

Assignment #2 (1 -Day Trip with a scheduled PCH of 6 PCH), he shall 
need to use Three (3) Sick Days in his Sick Bank to protect the eighteen 
(18) PCH, as a result of the Trip Trade decreasing his Line PCH.  In this 
example, the  Pilot uses the same number of  Sick Days, but protects a 
higher PCH value. In the event the Pilot only had two (2) Sick Days in h is 
Sick Bank, the Sick Days would’ve been used for Assignment #1, which 
would’ve protected twelve (12) PCH and the net affect w ould have been 
a loss of six ( 6) PCH (Assignment #2) from the Pilot’s Line PCH.  
 
e. As provided in subsections 3.P.1 and 3.P.2., all earned PCH and Open 
Time Premium shall be in addition to the MPG, as provided in subsection 
3.N.   
 
3. If the Company cancels a Pilot’s Open Time award less than twelve (12) 
hours prior to his Duty on Time (“DOT”) or he is Replaced on any portion of 
an awarded Open Time Assignment, he shall, nonetheless, receive Open 
Time Premium for the scheduled PCH of his awarded Trip Pairing, Reserve 
Duty or other Company -directed Duty Assignment from Open Time, or his 
DPG for each scheduled Duty Day, whichever is greater.

                                                   NEW AIRCRAFT  
 
 
A. AIRCRAFT TYPES . 
 
1. A New Aircraft Type is defined as an Aircraft Type with a distinct Aircraft 
model or Type that is not presently being operated under the Company’s 
operating certificate.  
 
2. A Derivative Model of an Aircraft Type is defined as an Aircraft that does 
not require a separate Type Rating than does the current basic model of 
that Aircraft Type, but may require Federal Aviation  Administration (“FAA”) 
mandated Differences Training and the parties have agreed does not 
require separate Vacancy Bids, as provided in Section 18 (Filling of 
Vacancies)  
 
B. FILLING OF NEW AIRCRAFT  VACANCIES .

Initial Cadre Check Airmen (“ICCA”) on that New Aircraft Type, the 
Company may temporarily obtain the ser vices of another ICCA, as follows:   
 
a. The Company may select  an ICCA from those Pilots who bid and were 
awarded a First Officer Vacancy on the New Aircraft Type and who have

sufficiently experienced to satisfy the FAA and become ICCA on the 
New Aircraft Type. Unless there is an insufficient number of Captains 
and/or First Officers who have sufficient experience or an interest in 
becoming an ICCA, the ratio of New Hire ICCAs to current Seniority List 
Pilots who has the experience and desire to become an ICCA, shall  be 
one-to-five (1:5).  All New Hire ICCAs shall be placed on the Northern 
Air Cargo Pilots System Seniority List (“Seniority List”), as provided in 
Section 16 (Seniority), prior to assuming any ICCA duties.

be compensated for that Position accordingly, as provided in Section 3 
(Compensation); and, (3) he shall have his time spent as an IC CA 
credited against the time required for his Probationary Period, as 
provided in Section 16 (Seniority).   
 
f. When a Pilot has been awarded a Vacancy in a New Aircraft Type and 
he is withheld from his awarded Training Date, as provided in Section 
18 (Filling of Vacancies) while a less senior ICCA is occupying that 
Position, he shall be pay protected, as provided in subsection 3.W., Pay

3.  Pilots enrol ling in health  insurance coverage must contribute the difference 
between the Month ly rates set by MCTWF for each Plan’s Coverage Tier, 
as provided in subsection 5.C.10., and the Company’s contribution (per 
Pilot) for each MCTWF Plan Coverage Tier as provided in Subsecti on 5.C.4.  
Pilot contributions for health and welfare coverage shall be made by payroll 
deduction by the Company and remitted by the Company on their behalf to 
the MCTWF.   
 
4.  The Company’s Total Contribution for health insurance coverage for all 
Pilots in the bargaining unit covered by this Agreement, shall not exceed 
$71,916.67 ($863,000 annually) per Month, based on a 98 -pilot bargaining 
unit from the inception of MCTWF coverage, as provided in Subsection 
5.C.2, until December 31, 2018.  Thereafter, th e Company’s Total 
Contribution shall be subject to an annual adjustment on the Effective Date 
of MCTWF Plan rates each Year , as provided in Subsection 5.C.10.1  
Annual adjustments to the Company’s Total Contribution shall be based as 
follows:   
 
a. The lesser of six percent (6%) or the “weighted” average rate change for 
health insurance policies provided for the Company’s non -Pilot 
employees at its Anchorage and Honolulu Domiciles. The Company’s 
contribution shall be adjusted down if the average r ate change for  non-
Pilot employees is a negative number.  
 
b. As provided in this subsection 5.C.4.b., these yearly, weighted averages 
shall be used for determining the yearly average adjustment to the 
Company’s health Insurance costs. The following percentages are the 
2018 Pilot census data for Pilot enrollment in each Company plan, as of 
June 1, 2018.  The following percentage in each plan is as follows:  
 
               NAC        AAC 
(1) ALASKA HSA: 23%                      (1) HSMA 739: 13%  
(2) ALASKA PPO: 30%    (2) HSMA 753:28 % 
(3) Hawaii Kaiser HMO: 6%  
 
c.   When determining the yearly health Insurance cost increases for the 
Company, the Company shall use the higher cost of the same Company 
provided health Insurance plans that were in effect at the DOS of this 
1 As of the DOS of this Agreement presently known MCTWF Plan rate changes are effective on 
March 31, 2019, March 29, 2020 and April 4, 2021.  Rate change Effective Dates thereafter shall 
be determined by the MCTWF Trustees.     DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708

Agree ment or if the Company purchases additional plan(s) that provide 
equal or greater health insurance benefits for its non -Pilot employees, 
those new plan(s) shall be used for comparison purposes.  A health 
insurance plan that provides a “significantly” reduced health insur ance 
benefit that replaces a health insurance plan that was in effect as of the 
DOS for the non -Pilot employees, shall not be used for future 
calculations under this Section 5 (Retirement and Insurance).  In such a 
case, the percentage adjus tment for the r eplaced plan that was 
applicable in the Year prior to replacement shall be used instead of the 
replacement plan in future Company contribution calculations.   
 
(1)  For purposes of Subsection 5.C.4.c, “significantly reduced health 
insurance benefit” means more than a six percent (6%) increase in 
projected average employee out of pocket expenses associated with 
obtaining insurance coverage (including deductibles, co -pays and 
maximum limits).  The term does not include loss of a particular 
medi cal provider or  facility from a network, or changes in cost -saving 
measures such as wellness program or generic drug discounting.  
 
(2)  This Subsection 5.C.4.c is not applicable where a health insurance 
plan   listed in Subsection 5.C.4.b is changed or replaced as a res ult 
of federal, state or local law requirements.  For instance, Company 
cost percentage changes that are due to plan modifications or 
replacements mandated by the State of Hawaii to HMSA 739 and/or 
753, shall be included in the annual cost c alculation with  the new 
mandated modifications or replacements in effect.   
 
(3)  The following example illustrates what happens when one of the 
plans stated in Subsection 5.C.4.b is replaced:   
 
(i) For 2019, the non -Pilot’s plans stated in Subsection 5.C.4.b have 
increased  from 2018 as follows:

(iii) In this example, the r eplacement plan was a significantly reduced 
benefit, so the increase number fo r that plan is 5%, which is the 
percentage by which the plan it replaced increased from 2018 to 
2019.         
    
 
d.  The following examples shall be used when calculating the c ompany’s 
annual adjustment for health Insurance:  
 
 (1) For example, rates to be in effect on January 1, 2019 for the 
Company’s non -Pilots are increased from the previous Plan Year by 
four percent (4%) in Hawaii HMSA 753, three percent (3%) in Hawaii 
HMSA 739, two percent (2%) in Hawaii Kaiser HMO, five percent 
(5%) in Alaska HSA Plan, and six percent (6%) in Alaska PPO Plan.2  
The “weighted” average rate increase for all Plans is four and six 
tenths percent (4.6%).  Under this scenario, and assuming there has 
been no increase in the total number of Pilots in the bargaining unit 
who are eligible for Company health insurance contributions since 
the DOS of this Agreement, the Company’s Total Contri bution 
beginning March 31, 2019 shall be increased by four and six tenths 
percent (4.6%), for a total Contribution of $75,224.84 ($71,916.67 
plus four and six tenths percent (4.6%)) per Month.   
 
(2) If the weighted average rate is, for example, a negative  two and one 
tenth’s percent (2.1%) for 2019, the Company’s con tribution per Pilot 
beginning March 31, 2018 will decrease by that amount: $71,916.67 
less 2.1% = $70,406,42.   
 
(3) If the weighted average rate change for non -Pilot employees for 2019 
is, for example, a six and nine tenth’s percent (6.9%) increase, the 
Compa ny’s contribution beginning March 31, 2019 is capped at six 
percent (6%).  In such case, its maximum contribution for the Pilot 
base line group is $76,231.67 ($71,916.67 plus 6%), or $777.88 pe r 
Pilot.   
 
e.  The Company’s contribution is subject to annual  adjustment due to any 
increase in the total number of Pilots in the bargaining unit who are 
eligible for health insurance (i.e. Pilots who are not on Furlough or 
Leaves of absence not qualifying for Company health insurance

contributions).  Any increase in the Company’s Total Contribution due to 
an increase in the total number of Pilots in the bargaining unit shall be 
calculated as of February 1 each Year  on the basis of the Company’s 
cost per Pilot at the DOS of this Agreement.  The average cost per Pilot  
at the DOS is $733.85 per Month ($71,916.67 ÷ 98).  The Company’s 
Total Contribution shall increase by $733.85 per Month per additional 
Pilot, adjusted each Year  to reflect MCTWF rate increase s, as provided 
in subsection 5.C.10. The following is an exampl e of the calculation due 
to an increase in Pilots:   
 
(1) On February 1, 2019, the total number of Pilots in the bargaining unit 
who are eligible for Company contributions for MCTWF health 
insurance coverage has increase to 106 pilots, an increase of eight  
(8) Pilots.  The Company’s Total Contribution shall increase by 
$5,870.75 ($733.85 X 8) to $77,787.42 ($71.916.67 + $5,870.75) per 
Month.  That new Monthly Total Contribution is then subject to any 
weighted average rate change as provided in subsection 5. C.4.a.  If 
that weighted average change is, for example, a four and six tenths 
percent (4.6%) increase between 2018 and 2019, the Company’s 
Monthly Total Contribution beginning March 31, 2019 w ill be 
$81.365.64 ($77,787.42 plus four and six tenths percent (4.6%).   
 
(2) Under the previous example, the per Pilot Monthly contribution by 
the Company would increase to $767.60 per Pilot if non -Pilot rates 
increase by a weighted average of four and six tenths percent 
(4.6%).  They would decrease to 718.44 per pilot if average r ates for 
non-Pilots decrease by two and one -tenth percent (2.1%).  
 
5.  A Special Open Enrollment Period for MCTWF Plans for (60) Days shall 
commence not later than the Day after the DOS of this Agreement.  
Thereafter, Pilots may opt into MC TWF coverage when hired or, for existing 
Pilots, during the next Special Open Enrollment Period that is scheduled for 
7/01/21 with an Effective Date of 8/29/21. If no re -enrollment form is 
received from a Pilot wishing to change plans, he shall be required  to 
continue to  participate in his current elected plan for an additional three (3) 
Years. A new Special Open Enrollment Period shall commence once every 
three (3) Years  during the Month of July.   
 
6.  A Pilot may make a change to his/her Coverage Tier el ection during a ny 
Special Open Enrollment Period or at any time when he has a change of 
circumstances as defined in IRS guidelines (e.g., divorce, children reaching 
the age of 26, marriage, child birth, etc .).  
 
7.  A Pilot may opt -out of MTWF Plan coverag e during the 20 18 Special 
Enrollment Period or during any Special Open Enrollment Period, provided 
the Pilot provides  DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708

 proof of primary health insurance coverage that is satisfactory to the 
MCTWF.   
 
8.  A Pilot who is in the bargaining unit at the DOS of  this Agreement  and has 
“opted -out” of health insurance under the MCTWF may elect to enroll into a 
MCTWF plan, if and when allowed by controlling plan documents.  When a 
Pilot opts into a MCTWF plan, health Insurance coverage for the Pilot and 
any covered dependents shall begin on the first (1st) Day of the following 
Month, after approval of his enrollment. Any adjustments to the Company 
contribution, as a result of pilot “opt -ins” under this Subsection shall not 
change until the following March 31st.  
  
 
9.  As provided in subsections 5.C.4.a through 5.C.4.e., a Pilot’s Monthly 
Contributions for each MCTWF Plan and Coverage Tier through March 30, 
2019, shall be determined on the basis of how many Pilots are enrolled in 
MCTWF coverage and after apportioning  the Company’s Total Contribution 
between MCTWF Plans and Coverage Tiers:  
 
  a.   To determine the Pilot contribution rate for each MCTWF Plan and 
Coverage Tier, the Company’s Total Monthly Contribution shall be 
calculated, as provided in subsection 5.C.4  for each Plan and Coverage 
Tier.   
 
b.  For MCTWF coverage through March 30, 2019, the number of Pilots who 
are enrolled in MCTWF coverage shall be determined in the Special 
Open Enrollment Period as provided in subsection 5.C.5.  For purposes 
of calculat ing the Company’s contribution to be effective at the time of 
MCTWF rate changes each Year thereafter, the total number of enrolled 
Pilots shall be determined as of the first (1st) Day of February in that 
Year.       
 
c.  Pilot Contribution rates for each M CTWF Plan and Coverage Tier, which 
are the difference between the MCTWF rates and Company 
contributions for each MCTWF Plan and Coverage Tier, shall be 
determined by agreement between the Union’s Executive Council 
(EXCO) and the applicable Company represen tatives by December 1 
each Year  for the following Year.3 Between February 1st and February 
25th of each new Year, the Union and Company representatives shall 
meet to determine to what extent, if any, a change in the previous Year’s 
cost sharing relationshi p between the Pilot and the Company needs 
adjustment for the upcoming new Year. Once a determination is made 
by the parties, they shall communicate the results of their meeting to all 
Pilot’s prior to the new Year. The cost -share relationship for each new

c. In numerical order, the lowest numbered Composite Line shall be 
constructed with the highest  scheduled PCH. The next lowest numbered 
Composite Line’s scheduled PCH shall be equal to or lower than the 
previous lower numbered Composite Line. This progression shall 
continue until all Composite Lines ar e constructed.   
 
d. The minimum number of Composite Lines to be constructed in any 
Month shall equal the number of weeks of scheduled Vacation per 
Position and Domicile in a Month, divided by four (4), rounded up to the 
next whole integer ( e.g., 11 weeks of Vacation = 11/4 = 2.75, rounded 
up to a minimum of 3 Composite Lines for this Position and Domicile for 
the Month).   
 
12. Minimum Net Reserve Compliment  
 
All planned Reserve Assignments shall all be included in the initial Reserve 
Line Construction .   
 
a. All published Reserve Assignments scheduled on each Day of the 
Month in the Initial Lines shall be the Minimum Net Reserve 
Complement for each Day in that Month.   The Company may construct 
additional Reserve Assignments to cover increased flying or lack of 
Reserve Pilot coverage for any Day in the Mon th.   
 
b. All new Reserve Assignments shall be published and placed into Open 
Time, except for those Reserve Assi gnments that are constructed for a 
Pilot that completes Long -Term Training  or returns from a Leave of

number and type of Reserve Assignments that are available for each 
Day in that Month.   
 
13. Reserve Lines  
 
a. The Company shall, to the extent possible, construct Reserve Lines. 
Such Lines shall contain only Reserve Assignments. As provided in 
Section 15 (Reserve), the types of Reserve Assignments that may be 
constructed and placed onto a Reserve Line are: Domicile -Short Call 
Reserve Assignment (R1 R AP), Out -of-Domicile -Short Call Reserve 
Assignments (R2 RAP) and Long -Call Reserve Assignments (R -3).  
 
b. To the extent possible, the Company shall construct each Reserve Line 
with only R -1 RAP’s or only R -3 Reserve Assignments, except they may 
construct a Reserve Line that contains both blocks of R -1 RAP’s and R -
3 Reserve Assignments, so long as each block of Reserve Assignments 
contains the same type of Reserve Assignment.     
 
c. Reserve Lines containing R -2 RAPs shall be constructed with purely R -
2 RAPs , except when a R -2 RAP is scheduled within a Trip Pairing.   
 
d. All Days of R -1 RAPs, along with their individual DOT and Duty Off times 
shall be published in each R -1 Reserve Line.  R -1 DOTs and Duty Off 
may be scheduled differently, from Day to Day.   
 
e. Per Position and Domicile, all Reserve Lines shall be published in the 
Monthly Bid Period and available for all Eligible Pilot s to bid.   
 
f. Reser ve Assignments in a Reserve Line may be scheduled as a Single -

F. INTEGRATION PROCEDURES  
 
The Integration procedures during the Monthly Bid Period shall be 
accomplished in sequence, as follows:  
  
1. Vacation Integration  
  
a. Vacation Integration procedures:  
 
(1) Paid Time Off (“PTO”) Day s, as provided in Section 11 (Paid Time 
Off), shall replace all scheduled Duty and/or other Company -
Directed Assignments inside and/or outside a Vacation Block 
(single or consecutive Vacation Week(s)), when such Assignments 
“conflict” with the Vacation Blo ck.  Except as provided in 
subsections 14.F.1.a.(3) or 14.F.1.a.(4)., when a Trip Pairing 
conflicts wi th a Vacation Week(s), all such Assignments shall be 
dropped from a Pilot’s Line and placed into Open Time.  Available 
PTO Days in such Pilot’s PTO Bank, as provided in Section 11, shall 
protect the PCH value of the Assignments.  Conflicts inside his 
Vacat ion Block shall be resolved before covering any conflicts 
outside of the Vacation Block.  
 
(2) If a Pilot has insufficient PTO Days in his PTO Bank, as provided in 
Section 11, to cover all conflicts inside his Vacation Block, to the 
extent possible, his available PTO Days shall be used first on the 
conflicting Days with the highest PCH to protect the maximum PCH 
in his Line.  Once his PTO Days have been exh austed, the PCH of 
the remaining dropped Days shall not be protected and his Line 
PCH shall be reduced  accordingly.  
 
(3)  If a Pilot has insufficient PTO Days in his PTO Bank to cover the 
removed Days which conflict outside of his Vacation Block and it 
results in his Line PCH to fall below his MPG, the Company shall 
utilize his remaining PTO Days, beginni ng with the conflicting 
Day(s) closest to his Vacation Block and continue outward from the 
Vacation Block until the PTO Days in his PTO Bank is exhausted.   
After the exhaustion of his PTO Bank, if his Line PCH value remains 
below his MPG, the Company may elect to retain a portion of the 
Pilot’s conflicting Trip Pairing(s) that have not been replaced by 
PTO Days and require him to perform such Duty.  
 
(4) When a  Trip Pairing conflicts with a Pilot’s Vacation Block and the 
conflict extends outside of his Vacation  Block for more than three 
(3) Days in one or both directions of his Vacation Block, the Pilot 
may request to retain all or any portion of the conflicting  Pairing(s). 
If a Pilot makes such request, he must retain three (3) consecutive DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 170 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

Days or more of the Days of the conflicting Trip Pairing(s). When a 
Pilot requests to retain such flying , he shall make his selection 
during the Monthly Bid Period, as provided in subsection 14.C.6. or 
14.C.7. Retained Days shall begin with the Day(s) furthest away 
from his Va cation Block (beginning of, and/or end of the conflicting 
Trip Pairings) and proceed in consecutively towards the direction of 
his Vacation Block. Crew Scheduling shall integrate his Line by 
having the Pilot initiate or join his original Trip Pairing or as sign the 
Pilot Trip Pairing(s) and/or RAP(s) from Open Time on the same 
Days as the Days he elected to retain. If there are insufficient Duty 
in Open Time , Crew Scheduling shall place new R -1, or R -2 RAPs 
on those Days, to the extent that is necessary to bring his Line value 
up to his MPG. Once his Line PCH reaches his MPG, Crew 
Scheduling shall cease to add additional Duty to his Line.  
 
(5) When a Pilot h as been awarded a Composite Line, one (1) PTO Day 
shall be deducted from his PTO Bank, as provided in Section 11 
(Paid Time Off), for each scheduled Day of Vacation.  
 
(6) When a Pilot has been awarded a Reserve Line, one (1) PTO Day 
shall be  deducted from  his PTO Bank, as provided in Section 11 
(Paid Time Off), for each Reserve Duty Day inside his Block of 
Vacation.  
 
(7) A Pilot shall be compensated at the end of the Vacation Integration 
process, as provided in Section 3 (Compensation).  
 
b. Vacation Slide p rocedures:  
 
(1) At his option, a Pilot may move the start date of his single Week of 
Vacation or his Vacation Block a maximum  of three (3) Days in  
either  direction.  If exercised, the Pilot must notify the Co mpany 
within forty-eight (48) hours after the postin g of the Initial  Line 
Awards , as provided in subsection 14.C.6. or 14.C.7.  
 
(2) Consecutive Vacation Weeks are considered one (1) Vacation 
Block  for the purposes of sliding a Pilot’s Vacation.  A Vacation 
Block must stay intact when moving  in a Vacation S lide request.  
 
(3) All Trip Pairing(s) or Reserve Assignments on Days inside a Pilot’s 
Vacation Block after a Vacation Slide shall be removed and 
replaced with one (1) PTO Day for each Day with scheduled 
Assignments, as provided in subsection 14.F.1.a.  
 
(4) A Vacation Slide shall be denied when a Pilot attempts to slide his 
Vacation Block into a “conflict” and a portion of a Trip Pairing DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 171 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

remains outside of the Vacation Block. When a Pilot’s Vacation 
conflicts with a Trip Pairing, a Pilot may slide his Vac ation Block 
when, at the end of the slide, a conflict still exists with the same 
conflicting Trip Pairing or the slide removes the initial conflict but 
causes a subsequent one.    
 
(5) If a Pilot has insufficient PTO Days in his PTO Bank, as provided in 
Sectio n 11 (Paid Time Off), following a Vacation Slide that results 
in his adjusted Line PCH value to fall below MPG, he would enter 
SAP, as provided in subsection 14.G.3.a.  
 
 
 
 
2. Training Integration procedures:  
 
a. If a Trip Pairing(s) or Reserve Assignment(s) con flicts with a Pilot’s 
scheduled Training, as provided in Section 12 (Training), the 
conflicting Trip Pairing(s), or portion thereof, and/or conflicting 
Reserve Assignments shall be removed , and his scheduled Training 
Days shall be placed on his Line.   
   
b. If Training is scheduled to occur on a Pilot’s Day Off, such Training 
shall be placed on the Day(s) Off and such Days Off shall not be 
replaced.  
    
c. A Pilot shall be compensated for Training Integration, as provided in 
Section 3 (Compensation).  
 
3. Operating  Experience (“OE”) Integration  
  
a. If a F/O receives a Trip Pairing(s) in his Initial Line Award that is to 
be used for OE, during the Integration process, as provided in 
subsection 14.C.6. or 14.C.7, he shall have the Trip Pairing(s), or 
portion(s) thereof, dropped, to the extent the Trip Pairing is used for 
scheduled OE.  During the OE Integration process, the Company 
may assign the F/O to another Trip Pairing(s) on the same scheduled 
Workday(s) as his original Trip Pairing(s).  If the F/O is Assigned  a 
new Trip Pairing(s), his Line PCH shall be adjusted to reflect the PCH 
of the new Trip Pairing(s).  If the Company does not assign the F/O 
a new Trip Pairing, his Line PCH shall be adjusted to reflect the 
removal of his original Trip Pairing(s).   
 
b. A F/O shall be compensated for OE Integration, as provided in 
Section 3 (Compensation).

4. Military Duty /Leaves of Absence (“LOA”) Integration  
 
a. If a Pilot is required to perform Military Duty, he shall notify the Chief 
Pilot as soon as possible once he receives his orders and knows the 
specific Day(s) he is scheduled for such Military Duty.  He shall have 
his Trip Pairing(s) removed from his schedule and the applicable 
scheduled PCH shall be deducted from his Line’s PCH value.   
 
b. A Pilot who has been awarde d a Leave of Absence (“LOA”), as 
provided in Section 8 (Leaves of Absence), shall have any Trip 
Pairing(s) and Reserve Assignments that conflicts with the Days he 
is on LOA dropped from his schedule and the applicable scheduled 
PCH shall be deducted from h is Line’s PCH value.  If his Line’s PCH 
value falls below MPG, his MPG shall not be protected, except as 
otherwise provided in this Agreement.   
 
5. Month -End Integration  
 
a. If a Pilot’s scheduled Trip Pairing or Reserve Assignment  in the current 
Month conflicts with his scheduled Trip Pairing or Reserve Assignment 
in the new Month (Transition Assignment), the Trip Pairing(s) or Reserve 
Assignment(s), or portions thereof, in the new Month shall be removed 
to alleviate the Month -end conflict, with a minimum loss of PCH to his 
new Line’s PCH value.   
 
b. If a Pilot is projected to exceed any limitations, as provided under the 
Federal Aviation Regulations (“FARs”) or in this Agreement, due to an 
Assignment in the new Month, the Assignme nt in the new Month, or 
portions thereof, shall be removed to alleviate the Month -end conflict, 
with the minimum loss of PCH to his new Line’s PCH Value.   
 
c. Notwithstanding the Maximum Scheduled Workday limitation for Line 
Construction , as provided in subsection 14.E.3., for all Lines, if a 
Transition Assignment carries into the new Month and ends within the 
first five (5) Days the Month (Transition Days) any Scheduled Days Off  
that are lost by the such Assignment shall not be restored during the 
Integra tion Period. If a Transitio n Assignment carries into the New Month 
and extends beyond the Transition Days, Crew Scheduling shall 
integrate his Line by dropping, on a Day for Day basis, other Trip 
Pairings and/or Reserve Assignments in the New Month for the  purpose 
to recover all Scheduled Days Off  that are lost due to the Transition 
Assignment, except, a Pilot may direct Crew Scheduling during the Initial 
Line Protest Period, as provided in subsections 14.C.6. and 14.C.7., to 
not integrate his Line for the purpose of recovering all or any portion of 
such Days Off. When Assignments are dropped from a Pilot’s Line 
during this Integration process, they shall be dropped, to the extent DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708

are covered by a Transition Assignment shall be considered part of the 
Maximum Scheduled Workdays for that Month.   
 
d. A Pilot shall be compensated for Month -End Integration, as provided in 
Section 3 (Compensation).  
 
 
 
G. SCHEDULE ADJUSTMENT PERIOD (“SAP”)  
  
1. General  
 
The SAP process allows a Pilot to modify his Initial Line Award through 
different transactions during the Monthly Bid Period.  All Trip Pairings and 
Reserve Assignments withheld during Line Construction , all n ew Trip 
Pairings or added Reserve Assignments c onstructed after the 
commencement of the Monthly Bid Period, if any, and all Trip Pairings, 
Reserve Assignments that are removed from Lines during the Integration 
Process shall be available in SAP.  After SAP awards have been made, all 
unassigned Trip Pair ings and/or Reserve Assignments shall be used in the 
construction of Composite Lines.  A Pilot shall have the opportunity to 
perform “Pick -ups” and/or “Trades,” but not “Drops” during the SAP process. 
The foll owing limitations shall apply to all SAP transa ctions:   
 
a. Reserve Assignments shall be placed into Open Time as a single

3. SAP Awards shall be made using the following procedures:  
 
a. When a Pilot’s Line PCH falls below his MPG as a result of the 
Integration process, as provided in subsection 14.F, he shall have 
“Super -Seniority” at the beginning of SAP.  If more than one (1) Pilot’s 
has similarly fallen below MPG, all Awards for Pilots who have Super -
Seniorit y in SAP shall be accomplished in Seniority Order.  A Pilot with 
Super -Seniority may submit Pick -up and/or Trade requests to recover 
his Line’s value PCH up to or over MPG, with the following limitations:   
 
(1) He shall only be awarded a Trade request if it involves only one (1)  
Trip Pairing or block of Reserve Assignments from Open Time and 
the result of the Trade increases his Line’s PCH value up to or over 
MPG.  
 
(2) Each of his Pick -Up Requests shall involve only one (1) Trip Pairing 
or block of Reserve As signments.  
 
(3) His Pick-up requests shall be awarded, beginning with the Trip 
Pairing or block of Reserve Assignments that has the highest PCH 
value, unless a request with a lower PCH value increases his Line’s 
PCH value up to or over MPG through that single transaction.  
  
b. After a Pilot with Super -Seniority has recovered his Line’s PCH value, 
as provided in subsection 14.G.3.a, he shall return to his appropriate DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708

and/or Reserve Assignments onto the remaining available Days of h is 
originally scheduled Assignments. The minimum number of Trip Pairings or 
Reserve Assignments shall be added until his Line’s PCH value is up to or 
over his MPG. If Crew Scheduling cannot recover a Pilots Line up to the 
MPG, they may add additional Trip Pairings and/or Reserve Assignments 
on his originally Scheduled Days Off  up to the Maximum Scheduled 
Workdays in the Month and to the extent possible at the beginning or end 
of a block of Days Off on his Line. After this process, the Company shall

B. PERMANENT VACANCIES.  
 
1. A Permanent Vacancy is a Position Vacancy at a Domicile that is 
anticipated to be greater than twelve (12) Months in duration. There are two 
types of Permanent Vacan cies: (1) Primary Vacancies; and, (2) Secondary 
Vacancies. A Pri mary Vacancy  is a Vacancy  that is posted in a Vacancy 
Bid, as provided in subsection 18.F.1.  After the awarding of a Primary 
Vacancy, a Secondary Vacancy is created when a Pilot  vacates his current 
Position and/or Domicile for a new Position and/or Domicile and the 
Company decides to fill that vacant Position. If the Company elects to fill a 
Secondary Vacancy, it shall be awarded, as provided in subsection 18.F.3.  
 
2. If there are unfilled Vacancies after the closing of a Vacancy Bid and 
associated Displacement, if any, the Company may fill an unfilled 
Permanent Vacancy with  a New Hire Pilot or leave the Vacancy unfilled.  
 
C. TEMPORARY DUTY VACANCIES (“TDY”).  
 
1. The Co mpany may establish Temporary Duty (“TDY”) Vacancies, as 
provided in subsection 18.C.4. A TDY Vacancy shall have a minimum of 
one (1) Month and a maximum of six (6) Months duration.  
 
2. Unless t he Union agrees otherwise, if the Company experiences a need f or 
twelve (12) or more consecutive Months of TDY Vacancies in a Position at 
a Domicile or geographic location, the Company shall establish a 
Permanent Vacancy for that Position at that Domicile or open a New 
Domicile, as provided in Section 21 (Domiciles),  for that Position at that 
geographic location.  
 
3. All procedures and operations for Pilots on a TDY Assignment shall be as 
provided elsewhere in the Agreement, unless the Company and the Union  
agree otherwis e; provided,  a Pilot on TDY shall bid for his M onthly Line of 
Flying in Seniority Order  with all TDY Pilots in his Position at a Domicile, but 
behind all Pilots in his Position who hold a Permanent Vacancy at that same 
Domicile.  
 
4. TDY loca tions shall be limited to the United States (including its territories); 
the Caribbean, except Cuba and Haiti; South America, except Venezuela 
and Columbia; Iceland; Europe, including Great Britain and Ireland; 
Canada; Australia; New Zealand; Vietnam; Sing apore; Thailand; China; 
South Africa and Japan. Notwithstanding this list, TDY’s shall not be 
permitted in any other country or in any country in this list that is declared a 
“Hostile Area,” as provided in Section 28, without the Company and the 
Union’s  compliance with this subsection 18.C.  
 
5. If the Company requests to establish TDY Vacancies at a geographic DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 207 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

location not listed in subsection 18.C.4., the Company and the Union shall 
meet and confer to discuss the purpose and merits of the request. Any 
exem ptions shall be on a case -by-case basis and memorialized in a 
separate L OA. If the parties cannot come to an agreement, the Company 
shall not establish such TDY location.  
 
6. To be eligible to bid on a TDY Vacancy, a Pilot must hold the same Positi on 
as th e TDY Vacancy. The Company may elect to limit eligibility to bid on a 
TDY Vacancy on a Domicile -specific basis in order to deal with a temporary 
surplus in that Position at that Domicile. If this occurs, only Pilots current 
and qualified in that Po sition a t that Domicile may bid on the TDY Vacancy.  
 
7. Pilots shall receive the following information when a TDY Vacancy is 
posted:  
 
a. The TDY location;  
 
b. Number of TDY Positions;  
 
c. Fleet;  
 
d. Domicile(s) eligibility restrictions, if any;

8. A Pilot who has been awarded a TDY Vacancy shall not be prohibited from 
subsequently being awarded a Permanent Vacancy or from being 
Displaced. Unless he is Displaced or Furloughed, a Pilot shall continue to 
occupy his TDY Vacancy until its duration date, provided , the Company 
may, on a case -by-case basis, allow a Pilot to vacate his TDY Assignment 
and enter Training for a new ly awarded Permanent Vacancy. If such Pilot is 
held in his TDY Assignment, he shall enter Training at the next available 
Training Date after he completes his TDY Assignment, as provided in 
subsection 18.C.1., and, if applicable, shall be eligible for Pay W hen 
Changing Positions, as provided in subs ection 3 .W. 
 
9. If TDY Vacancies remain unfilled after the close of the Vacancy Bid, the 
Company may assign the most junior Pilot to that TDY Vacancy who is 
current and qualified in that Position. I f the TDY Vacan cy notice contained 
a Domicile -specific bidding restriction, as provided in subsection 18.C.6., 
Pilots in that Position at that Domicile shall be Assigned to the TDY Vacancy 
in inverse Seniority Order . DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708

--- PAGE BREAK ---

 
10. When a Pilot is Involuntarily Assigned to a TDY Vacancy, as provided in 
subsection 18.C.9., the maximum duration of such Assignment shall be one 
(1) Month. If there are unfilled TDY Vacancies after the closing of the next 
Vacancy Bid, the next most junior Pilot, by Position, Fleet and if applicable, 
from the specified Domicile(s), shall be involuntarily Assigned to the unfilled 
TDY Vacancy(s) for a maximum duration of one (1) Month. If after the next 
Vacancy Bid, TDY Vacancies remain unfilled, the next most  junior Pilot, by 
Position, Fleet and if applicable, from the specified Domicile(s) shall perfor m 
the next TDY Assignment for a maximum duration of one (1) Month. This 
progression shall continue when unfilled TDY Vacancies exist until such 
time as all TDY Vacancies in a Vacancy Bid are bid voluntarily.  
 
11. The Company shall furnish a Pilot with lodging, transportation, other 
reasonable expenses and Per Diem, as provided in Section 6 (Expenses, 
Lodging & Transportation), for the entire time he occupies a TD Y Vacancy. 
Such time shall be computed from when he Reports for Deadheading to his 
TDY Vacancy location and ends upon his Deadheading return at his 
Domicile, as provided in Section 7 (Deadheading).  
 
12. While on a TDY, a Pilot shall be provided transportat ion between the 
Company -provided lodging and the TDY airport, for the entire period of such 
TDY until he is returned to his Domicile.  
 
13. Upon completion of a TDY Assignment a Pilot shall return to his current 
Domicile, unless, during that TDY Assignment,  he was Displaced or 
awarded a Vacancy at another  Domicile.  
 
14. A Pilot who was awarded a Vacancy while on TDY that required Training 
and was prevented by the Company from commencing such Training, as 
provided in subsection 18.C.8., shall receive no less than three (3) but no 
more than ten (10) Days Off  after the completion of the TDY Assignment 
before commencing Training for his new Position.  
 
D. DISPLACEMENTS.  
 
1. A Displacement occurs when the Co mpany reduces the number of 
Positions at a Domicile(s) or a Pilot is the most junior in his Position at a 
Domicile and is “Bumped” by a more senior Pilot, as provided in subsection 
18.E.1.  
 
2. If a Displacement(s) is to occur at a Domicile, a Pilot who h olds a TDY 
Vacancy in the Displaced Position shall ret urn to his current Domicile before 
a Pilot(s) in  that s ame Position at the TDY Domicile  is Displaced. Such 
Displaced TDY Pilot(s) shall r eturn to his current Domicile  in the following  
order:  DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708

--- PAGE BREAK ---

on the Company’s intranet. Such communications shall also be sent to a 
Furloughed Pilot’s personal email address on file with the Company.  
 
3. Vacancy and Displacement  Bids shall remain open for a minimum of 
fourteen (14) Days after posting, as provided in subsection 18.F.1.  All 
Permanent Vacancies shall be filled in Seniority Order  prior to the Company 
determining Displacements.  TDY Vacancies, if any, shall be filled after

4. A Pilot must accept a Vacancy or Displacement award predicated on his 
Standing Bid; provided , in the event of a bona -fide emergency situation not 
known to the Pilot at the time of the closing date that would preclude him 
from being able to accept. An affected Pilot sha ll immediately notify the 
Company of any such emergency situation.  
 
G. PILOTS NEARING RETIREMENT.  
 
1. The Company is not required to award a Permanent Vacancy requiring 
Transition or Upgrade Training to a Pilot who is within two (2) Year of 
mandatory Retir ement age.  
 
2. If the Company elects to not award a Permanent Vacancy to a Pilot nearing 
retirement, as provided in subsection 18.G.1., and that Vacancy has a 
higher Hourly Pay Rate than his current Position, he shall receive By -Pass 
Pay at the higher Hourly Pay Rate, as provided in Section 3 
(Compensation).  
 
H. AIRCRAFT FREEZES.  
 
1. A Pilot who has been awarded a Perman ent Vacancy that requires fifteen 
(15) Days or more of Training to qualify shall incur a two (2) Year “Aircraft 
Freeze.” Such Aircraft Freeze shall begin upon the Day the Pilot begins 
Operational Experience (“OE”) for such Position.

a. The Company may waive an Aircraft Freeze for a Vacancy Bid. If the 
Company waives an Aircraft Freeze, any Pilot, system -wide, who has DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 211 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

an existing Aircraft Freeze, shall also have his Aircraft Freeze waived 
for that Vacancy Bid.  
 
b. An Aircraft Freeze shall not restrict a Pilot from bidding into a higher 
Status ( i.e., First Officer to Captain);  
 
c. A Pilot’s Aircraft Freeze shall be waived for purposes of bidding  laterally 
in Status to a New Fleet, as provided in Section 4 (New Aircraft), during 
the first twenty -four (24) Month period after such New Fleet was added 
to the Company’s Operating Specifications. A Pilot may use this 
exception only one (1) time for each  New Fleet.  
 
Example: A B-737 F/O bids a F/O Vacancy on the B -767, which is a New 
Fleet that was recently added to the Company’s Operating 
Specifications. His B -737 Aircraft Freeze is waived,  and he incurs a new 
24-Month Aircraft  Freeze on the B -767. Six Months later, he is aw arded 
a B-737 Captain Vacancy. Because this is an upgrade, his B -767 Aircraft 
Freeze is waived,  and he incurs a new 24 -Month Aircraft  Freeze on the 
B-737. Six Month s later, a B -767 Captain Vacancy is posted. Because 
this Pilot was previously allowed to waiv e his B -737 F/O Aircraft Freeze 
to be awarded B -767 F/O Position on that New Fleet, he is ineligible to 
bid the B -767 Captain Position until his latest Aircraft Freeze is satisfied.  
 
4. A Captain shall be allowed to voluntarily down -bid to First Officer; provided , 
he shall be required to satisfy a twenty -four (24) Month Aircraft Freeze 
before again being allowed to Upgrade to Captain or Transition to a new 
Fleet.

1. A Pilot who has been awarded or Assigned to Train ing as a result of a 
Vacancy Bid or Displacement, may attempt to trade his Training date on a 
“man -for-man” basis with other Pilots who are also scheduled for Training 
from the same Vacancy Bid or Displacement. The result of a voluntary trade 
of a Training  date shall not result  in the implementation of any delay in 
Training provisions, as provided in subsection 18.I.2.  
 
2. For operational reasons, the Company may delay a Pilot’s Training for a 
new Position for up to ninety (90) Days beyond the date his new Permanent 
Vacancy was awarded. If a more junior Pilot who was awarded the same 
Position in the same or later Vacancy Bid begins receiving a higher Hourly 
Pay Rate for that Position, commensurate with his Longevity, as provided 
in Section 3 (Compensation), the delayed Pilot shall also begin receiving 
the higher Hourly Pay Rate for that new Position, commensurate with his 
Longevity.

SECTION 19  
GRIEVANCES  
 
 
A. GRIEVANCES.  
 
Any Pilot or group of Pilots covered by this Agreement who has a Grievance 
concerning any  Company rule or regulation or any action of the Company 
affecting them, shall have such Grievance considered in accordance with the 
following procedures. It is the intent of the Parties to resolve Grievances or 
potential Grievances informally and at the lowest level possible. There shall be 
an earnest effort on the part of all parties to settle Grievances  promptly in 
accordance with the procedures outlined herein. Ther e are two types of 
Grievances, Disciplinary and Non -Disciplinary.  
 
B. DISCIPLINARY GRIEVA NCES.  
 
1. A non -Probationary Pilot shall not be disciplined or discharged without just 
cause.  
 
2. Investigatory Procedures.  
 
a. The Company may apply and document corrective counseling to 
address an incident or conduct that is deemed to be a “Minor Offense .” 
However, a Minor Offense shall not be documented without written 
notice to and acknowledgement of the Pilot. A documented Minor 
Offense, as provided herein, is not considered discipline and, therefore, 
is not subject to the investigation process, as provided in subsection 
19.B.2; it may not be referenced in any subsequent Disciplinary  action, 
except as provided in subsection 19.B.19.  
 
b. Any alleged incident or conduct, including repeated conduct, deemed to 
be “serious,” “ major” or “ critical” offenses  and shall be subject to the 
Investigatory Process, as provided in subsection 19.B.2.  
 
c. This subsection shall not be used to preclude the Company’s 
consideration of prior discipline or counseling; provided,  such prior 
discipline or counseling is eligible to  be referenced, as provided in 
subsection 19.B.19, under its Progressive Discipline Policy in 
determining appropriate discipline for a current offense, which disciplin e 
shall be consistent with discipline imposed on Pilots in the past for the 
same or simil ar offense.  
 
d. Once the Company learns of an alleged incident or conduct that may be 
deemed to be a “ serious,” “ major” or “ critical” offense, it has thirty (30) 
Days to complete its investigation. Circumstances outside the DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 213 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

Company’s control that prevent s the completion of  such investigation 
within the thirty (30) Day period shall not preclude the Company from 
taking action against a Pilot based on the alleged incident or conduct.  
 
e. Discipline shall not take place if the alleged incident or conduct occurr ed 
more than one hundred eighty (180) Days prior to the Company 
commencing its investigation; except,  if steps were taken by a Pilot 
under investigation to actively conceal the alleged incident or conduct, 
the Company shall then have thirty (30) Days from the date it became 
aware of or should have become aware of the alleged incident or 
conduct to complete its investigation. Neither silence on the part of the 
Pilot, a failure to disclo se, n or a denial of the offense shall constitute 
active concealment, unless the Pilot had an affirmative legal obligation 
to have disclosed the alleged incident or conduct.  
 
f. The Company is not precluded from issuing appropriate discipline to a 
Pilot pen ding an investigation by the FAA or National Transportation 
Safety Board (“NTSB”) or other civil authority that may result in 
revocation or suspension of his Pilot’s License.  
 
3. Nothing herein shall prevent the Company from holding a Pilot out of service 
with pay pending completion of an investigation into possible discipline or 
discharge.  
 
4. If a Company representative chooses to have an informal discussion with a 
Pilot concerning an alleged incident or his conduct or requests that he 
provide a written statement regarding said matter, the Company 
representative shall first inform such Pilot that he may be subject to 
discipline or discharge as a result of the information he provides and that 
he has a right to Union Representation. A Pilot who declines to e ngage in 
such discussions or provide a written statement regarding such matter shall 
not be subject to discipline or discharge solely for such refusal.  
 
5. During its investigation, the Company may, at its discretion, refer the matter  
to the Union Professional Standards Committee (“PSC”) for resolution. In 
such case, the Company has fifteen (15) Days to complete its investigation 
after the PSC informs the Company it was not able to or did not choose to 
resolve the matter.  
 
6. If a Pilot is required to atten d a meeting with the Company held for the 
purpose of investigation of a m atter that may result in his discipline or 
discharge for a “ serious,” major” or “ critical offense,” he shall be so notified 
of an Investigatory Meeting. Such notice shall provide a su mmary of the 
allegations against the Pilot, a summary of the facts then k nown to the 
Company, the date and location of the alleged incident and the rule or policy 
or regulation allegedly violated. Such notice shall also advise him of his right DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 214 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

to request Union Representation. A copy of the notice shall also be sent to 
the Union  at the time it is sent to the Pilot.  
 
7. The scheduled date of an Investigatory Meeting shall be no less than five 
(5) Days after the earlier of the date the Pilot acknowledges recei pt of 
written notification or the date the notice is personally delivered  to the Pilot. 
If the Pilot requests, he may have a Union Representative , or another Pilot 
of his choosing present at the Investigatory Meeting; provided, the 
attendance of the Union Representative or other Pilot, as may be 
applicable, does not unduly delay the conduct of the Investigatory Meeting. 
A request to delay an Investigatory Meeting for up to three (3) Business 
Days for the purpose of obtaining representation and/or for schedu ling 
purposes shall not be unreasonably denied by the Company. However, a ny 
delay in convening an Investigatory Meeting due to obtaining representation 
for the Pilot shall extend the deadline, as provided in subsection 19.B.2 by 
the number of delay Days.  
 
8. An Investigatory Meeting shall be held on the Pilot’s scheduled Workda y, 
unless otherwise mutually agreed upon, and shall normally be conducted 
telephonically. However, an Investigatory Meeting concerning a matter that 
may ultimately lead to termination  or suspension of service shall be 
conducted in -person at the Pilot’s Domicile, unless the parties agree 
otherwise.  
 
a. If an Investigatory Meeting is held on a Pilot’s Workday before or after 
his scheduled Assignment, he shall be considered on continuous Duty 
for the entirety of his scheduled Assignment combined with the elaps ed 
time of the Investigatory Meeting. His total Duty Time must comply with 
the limitations, as provided in Section 13 (Hours of Service), and he shall 
be compensated for such Duty, as  provided in Section 3 
(Compensation).  
 
b. If an Investigatory Meeting conflicts with a Pilot’s scheduled Duty 
Assignment, he shall be removed from such Assignment to the extent 
necessary and shall be compensated, as provided in Section 3 
(Compensation), f or the PCH value of the removed Assignment. Such 
Pilot shall not be Reassigned to any new Assignment on the same Day 
as the Investigatory Meeting.  
 
9. Upon request, the Company shall provide the Union with copies of any 
documents, including witness statements, the Company has in its 
possession that it believes supports the alle gations against the Pilot. The 
Union shall be allowed sufficient time to review the information prior to the 
start of the Investigatory Meeting. Upon request, the Union shall provide the 
Company with copies of any documents, including witness statements, t he 
Union has in its possession that it believes refutes the allegations against DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 215 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

such Pilot. The parties may redact information that they consider sensitive, 
confidential or proprietar y. 
 
10. During the course of the Investigatory Meeting, the Pilot under i nvestigation 
or the Union shall have the opportunity to present information, including the 
testimony or statements of witnesses, and to ask questions of the 
Company’s representative(s).  
 
11. The Company shall be responsible for payment of Per Diem and any 
associated travel costs, including transportation and lodging, if any, as 
provided in Section 6 (Expenses, Lodging and Transportation), if necessary 
for a Pilot under investigation to attend a required Investigatory Meeting 
under this Section 19.

a. The minimum required number of Composite Lines to be publishe d shall be 
based on the following staffing formula: Composite Lines shall equal the 
number of scheduled Vacation weeks that begins in such Month,  divided by 
four (4), rounded up to the next whole integer (e.g., 11 w eeks of Vacation =

f. To the extent possible, at least two (2) scheduled Days Off sh all separate 
blocks of Trip Pairings, except for the first and last Day of t he Bid Period. 
When this limitation in a Composite Line cannot be met b ecause the 
Composite Line’s PCH value is below the MPG, the sch eduled Days Off 
between Trip Pairings may be reduced to one (1) scheduled Day Off until the 
minimum MPG has been met. 
 
g. The lowest numbered Composite Line in each Position and Domicile shall be 
constructed with the highest scheduled PCH, followed by a Co mposite Line

otherwise provided in this Section 14, all Lines shall be bid for and awarded in 
Seniority  Order,  in each  Position,  per Domicile.  Each  Position  and Domicile  shall 
utilize either the Primary or Secondary Bid Process, as authorized by the  JSC.  
 
2. The prioritization for constructing Initial Lines, in the following sequential orde r, 
shall be administered each Month when constructing all Lines for each Position 
in a Domicile:  
 
a. The total number of constructed Initial Lines, Including Domicile Flex Lines, 
shall equal and not exceed the number of its bidding Pilots in each Position 
at a Domicile for that  Month.  
 
b. All Regular,  Composite,  Reserve  and Domicile  Flex Lines  shall have  at least 
two (2) separate  periods  of at least  three  (3) consecutive  Days  Off or a single

Known  Flying.  
 
(1) The Company shall, to the maximum extent possible construct Trip 
Pairings with the highest PCH into Regular Lines and holdback Trip 
Pairings with a lesser PCH value in Open Time, however, the Company 
shall not be restricted from optimizing Regular Line Construction by

constructed.  

--- PAGE BREAK ---

 
(2) The Company  shall build  the maximum  number  of Regular  Lines,  without 
any Reserve Assignments, for each Initial Line Bid  Period.

Reserve Assignments as provided in subsection  14.E.5.a.  
 
h. When constructing Regular Lines, the lowest numbered published Line  shall 
be constructed with the maximum PCH. The following lowest numbered 
Regular  Line shall be constructed  with the same  or less PCH  as the previous

constructed that results in reducing the Trip Pairing PCH for that specific 
Position  and Domicile  to a level at least  below  fifteen  percent  (15%)  PCH,  but 
great er than three percent (3%) of such total  PCH.  
 
i. Once the Initial phase of the Regular Lines has concluded, the required 
Composite and Reserve Lines, as provided in this Section 14, shall be 
constructed.  In the event  there  is an inadequate  number  of Pilots  to build  the 
required number of Reserve and/or Composite Lines in a Position at a 
Domicile,  the Company  may construct  R2 Reserve  Lines  in another  Domicile 
to supplement temporary staffing deficits in such Domicile. In all cases, 
Composite  Line const ruction  shall supersede  Reserve  Line construction  and 
Regular  Line construction  shall supersede  both Composite  and Reserve  Line 
construction.  
 
j. If three (3) or more Reserve Lines are constructed and there are Pilots 
requesting to bid for Domicile Flex Lines, fifty percent (50%) of the Reserve 
Lines, rounded up to the nearest whole integer, shall be constructed as 
Domicile Flex Lines for those pilo ts requesting a Domicile Flex  Line.  
 
k. Once it is determined how many Domicile Flex Lines shall be published and 
if additional Lines that can be built utilizing the construction parameters in 
subsection 14.E.6., the Company, in consultation with the JSC, sha ll 
construct additional Regular and/or Reserve Lines until no other Lines can 
be constructed. When additional Reserve Lines are created and if there are 
additional  Pilots  who are requesting  to bid for Domicile  Flex Lines,  such  Lines 
shall be constructed  using the ratio as provided  for in this subsection  14.E.2.j.  
 
3. All TDY Lines shall be constructed as other Lines, with the following  exceptions:  
 
a. All Trip Pairings  in a TDY Line,  shall be scheduled  to originate  and end at the

otherwise cease to be effective only pursuant to paragraph 9 o r 12, below.   The 
pilots employed by Carrier A will be represented by IBT only pursuant to 
certification by the National Mediation Board or if they become employed by 
NAC.  
 
3. Following acquisition of Carrier A, Carrier A may be operated indefinitely as a 
separate subsidiary of NAS, unless and until management provides written 
notice to IBT of its intent to fully merge the operations of Carrier A with those 
of NAC. In such event, this LOA will remain in force, and the operations of 
Carrier A and NAC will be fe nced, pending completion of the procedures of 
Section 1.G. of the CBA.   Upon completion of Section 1.G procedures, this LOA

other remedies available to the Un ion in the event of a violation, Carrier A, NAS 
and NAC agree the following remedies apply as a result of a prohibited transfer:  
 

--- PAGE BREAK ---

A. NAS and NAC have joint and several liability for liquidated damages to the 
craft or class of NAC Pilots in an amount equal to $100,000.00 per day from

owned by NAS:  
i. NAC Crewmembers on Furlough, if any, shall be immediately 
recalled to Active Service;  
ii. NAC Crewmembers are not subject to Furlough;  
iii. NAC Crewmembers are not subject to downgrade;  
iv. There shall be no reduction in NAC Crewmember compensation or 
benefits as a direct or an indirect result of the violation; and  
v. The growth of the craft or class of P ilots shall not be slowed as a 
direct or indirect result of the violation. Accordingly, if this 
subparagraph is in effect, Letter of Agreement 01 -004 is 
automatically amended to account for flying performed by Carrier A 
rather than the Pilots covered by th e CBA.  
 
C. At the election of the Union:  
i. the exemption from the CBA in Paragraph 2 of this LOA shall cease 
to apply to Carrier A;  
ii. the Union and the Company shall initiate and exhaust the procedures

in effect until Carrier A is again wholly owned by NAS. In addition, 
the NAS, NAC and Carrier A would remain liable to the NAC Pilots 
for any payments and damages under any other part of this LOA that 
accrued prior to termination.  
 
10. NAC and NAS shall submit, and NAS shall require Carrier A to submit, to the 
jurisdiction of the System Board of Adjustment to resolve any dispute r elated

B. Carrier A is required to treat with IBT beyond the scope of its submission to 
the System Board; or  
 
C. Carrier A is subject, or not, to the Railway Labor Act.

material condition of any future transaction that results in NAS maintaining any 
ownership or control of any portion of Carrier A.  
 
12. In addition to any cease  and desist  remedies,  which shall apply in the case of 
violat ions referred to in this Paragraph , and any other remedies available to the 
Union,  the parties further agree that if Carrier A violates Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 
or 11 of this LOA the following remedies shall also apply:  
 
A. NAS and NAC would have joint and seve ral liability for liquidated damages 
to the craft or class of NAC Pilots in an amount equal to $100,000.00 per 
day from the date of the violation until compliance has been established; in 
the event of such a remedy, IBT shall be wholly responsible for dire cting 
NAS and/or NAC how to allocate such funds among the Pilots;  
 
B. The following provisions shall be implemented until the subject violation 
ends:  
i. NAC Crewmembers on Furlough, if any, shall be immediately 
recalled to Active Service;  
ii. NAC Crewmembers are not subject to Furlough;  
iii. NAC Crewmembers are not subject to downgrade;  
iv. There shall be no reduction in NAC Crewmember compensation or

direct or indirect result of the violation. Accordingly, if this 
subparagraph is in effect, Letter of Agreement 01 -004 is 
automatically amended to account for flying performed by Carrier A 
rather than the Pilots covered by the CBA.  
 
C. At the election of the Union:  
i. the exemption from the CBA in Paragraph 2 of this LOA shall cease 
to apply to Carrier A; and/or  
ii. the Union and the Company shall initiate and exhaust the procedures 
set forth in Paragraph 6(f) of Letter of Agreement #7.  
 
13. In the event NAS, NAC and/or Carrier A violates Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 
11, and/or 12, the parties agree the Union shall be irreparably harmed. 
Therefore, the parties agree the Union shall be entitled to injunctive relief 
restraining NAS, NAC and/or Car rier A for violations of Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 
9, 10, 11 and/or 12, but such relief shall not be the exclusive remedy. The 
parties also agree the Union shall be entitled to injunctive relief to require the 
performance of the obligations of Paragraphs 5, 6 , 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and/or 12.  
 
14. There shall be no constraints on Carrier A’s passenger flying under Part 135.  
 
15. Operations under this LOA by Carrier A shall not directly or indirectly: (1) cause 
the Furlough or prevent the Recall of Pilots; (2) reduce the com pensation or 

--- PAGE BREAK ---

benefits of Pilots; (3) reduce the number of Pilots in any Position; or (4) slow 
the growth of the craft or class of Pilots.  
 
16. NAC shall not subcontract, consign, convey, transfer, assign or divert flying to 
Carrier A, and Carrier A shall not o therwise perform flying that NAC could 
perform, if doing so directly or indirectly causes the reduction of revenue flying 
conducted by NAC.  
 
A. Revenue flying conducted by NAC for purposes of this LOA shall be 
measured based on Block Time PCH within the indi vidual geographic 
marketplaces (e.g. within a specific state; between states; or to, from 
and/or within other geographic areas served (e.g., the Caribbean)) 
within which NAC and Carrier A both operate. In accordance with the 
foregoing, Carrier A operations  within an individual geographic 
marketplace in which NAC operates shall not directly or directly cause a 
reduction of NAC Block Time PCH within that individual geographic 
marketplace.  
 
B. NAC Block Time PCH shall be measured monthly based on the monthly 
average over a three -month  period as compared to the monthly average 
over the same three -month  period during the preceding three years.    
a. For example, to assess in December if there has been a loss of 
Block Time PCH during the months of September -November 
2022, the average Block Time PCH for September -November 
2022 would be compared to the average Block Time PCH for 
September -November 2019, 2020 and 2021.  
 
C. Without limiting the application of this paragraph 16, the Parties agree 
that nothing in this LOA shall prohibit Carrier A from continuing to 
perform the flying it is performing on the date the parties reached a 
tentative agreement on this LOA, and doing so does not violate this LOA.  
 
D. Carrier A’s passenger flying under Part 135, and operations under Part 
91, are excluded from this Paragraph 15.  
 
E. In the case of a proven violation, an arbitrator shall order that NAC shall 
cease and desist from continuing the violation, and/or Carrier A shall 
cease and desist continuing the violation, and NAC shall make payment 
to pilots equal to the loss of Block Time PCH compensation (separately 
calculated based on average Captain and First Officer rates for pilots 
Domiciled in the affected geographic marketplace and aircraft type) 
during which the proven violation occu rred, and restore the reduced 
flying caused directly or indirectly by Carrier A conducting the flying, in 
addition to any other appropriate remedy.  In the event of such a 
monetary remedy, IBT shall be wholly responsible for directing NAS 
and/or NAC how to allocate such funds among the Pilots.  

--- PAGE BREAK ---

a. If NAC claims the reduced flying cannot be restored to NAC as a 
result of customer requirements or because the flying no longer 
exists in the NAC system, the burden is on NAC to prove such 
claim.  The Company shall pro vide information to the Union in 
support of such a claim in accordance with Paragraph 17.  
 
17. The Union shall be provided on a monthly basis information regarding NAC and 
Carrier A’s operations, including operational and flight data, necessary to audit 
and de termine compliance with this LOA. NAC or NAS shall provide the 
information to the Union no later than the fifteenth day of the month. The 
Company may require recipients of data pursuant to this paragraph to execute 
appropriate non -disclosure agreements. Th e information to be produced to the 
Union is as follows:  
 
A. All NAC flight segments in the geographic marketplace(s) in which 
Carrier A operates for the preceding month, including aircraft type, tail 
number, city pairs, and Block Time PCH. The information shall be 
provided to the Union in Excel format on an individ ualized and aggregate 
basis.  
 
B. All Carrier A flight segments for the preceding month, including aircraft 
type, tail number, city pairs, block time, and pounds of cargo per 
segment.  
 
C. If NAC claims in response to a grievance that certain flying referred to i n 
Paragraph 16(A) could not be performed by NAC (e.g., due to equipment 
type, regulations, or customer requirements (but not because Carrier A 
can perform the flying more economically)), the burden shall be on NAC 
to prove the flying could not have been pe rformed by NAC. NAC shall 
provide the Union with all documents and information it relies upon or 
considers relevant to its claim (e.g., RFPs and relevant 
correspondence).  “Information” as used in this paragraph shall not 
include any documents or other inf ormation that is attorney/client 
privileged. NAS, NAC and/or Carrier A shall not enter into agreements 
with customers regarding “customer requirements” and/or structure its 
business relationships with customers with an intent to evade, or 
purpose of evadin g, monetary payments to NAC Pilots under Paragraph 
16.   
 
18. If NAS or NAC fails to provide the Union with information required under 
Paragraph 17 by the date it is due or any mutually agreeable extension thereto, 
the remedies shall be as follows, in addition  to any other remedies available to 
the Union:  
 
A. First proven violation: cease and desist and provide the information; and  
 

--- PAGE BREAK ---

B. Second and any subsequent proven violation: cease and desist, provide the 
information, and, if the refusal was not reasonably justified, reimburse the 
Union for costs and expenses associated with enforcing its right to the 
information under Paragraph 18 of the LOA.  
 
19. By signing this LOA, NAS agrees that Carrier A is bound by the terms of this 
LOA. Further, with respect to Carrier A’s obligations under this LOA, NAS 
agrees NAS and NAC are jointly and severally liable for any and all violations 
of such obligations.

consummation of the acquis ition of Carrier A, and shall remain in force 
contemporaneously with the CBA or until Carrier A is sold or otherwise 
transferred to another entity that is not an Affiliate of NAS or of the parent of 
NAS; provided, however, if Carrier A is sold, conveyed or  otherwise transferred 
to an Entity to which NAS and/or NAC is sold conveyed or otherwise transferred 
within the meaning of Section 1.F of the CBA, regardless of the structure of the 
transaction, then NAS and/or NAC will require the Entity, as an irrevocab le and 
material condition of the transaction, to assume this LOA in its entirety and 
assume all of  the obligations of NAS and/or NAC and Carrier A’s obligations 
under the this LOA.

Explanation of 
Proposed Letter of Agreement 
Re: Acquisition of Part 135 
Air Carrier 
A Presentation for Teamsters Pilots in the Service of Northern Air Cargo
Note: This document is intended for summary purposes only. The terms of the proposed LOA and 
other negotiated provisions in the ratification packet control for all purposes. 

--- PAGE BREAK ---

BACKGROUND
•NAS/NAC informed Union of a potential acquisition of a Part 135 air 
carrier.
•Negotiations between NAC/NAS and the air carrier are ongoing and 
subject to industry standard non -disclosure agreements until the 
transaction is completed.  As a result, the air carrier is referred to as 
“Carrier A” in the LOA and this presentation. The name will become 
public if transaction is finalized.
•Your EXCO and Teamsters Airline Division representatives received 
and reviewed requested information from NAS/NAC about Carrier A 
and engaged in extensive negotiations over the proposed LOA.

--- PAGE BREAK ---

OUR APPROACH 
•When management wants to discuss a matter that impacts Teamsters 
represented pilots, your Union engages management to protect and 
advance the best interests of the pilot group 
•While the acquisition involves a Part 135 carrier, not a Part 121 
carrier, the Union sought to limit risk and exposure to Teamsters 
represented pilots 
•With risks limited by the LOA, there is the possibility of Teamsters 
represented pilots sharing in the potential upside of the transaction, 
to include growth opportunities from improvements to the NAC 
network and increased revenues to support current pay, benefits and 
working conditions and future improvements

--- PAGE BREAK ---

EXCO RECOMMENDS THE MEMBERS 
RATIFY THE LOA 
•Good faith discussions led to the proposed LOA
•The proposed LOA will not take effect unless the Union membership 
ratifies it by a secret vote
•If the proposed LOA is ratified, it will govern the relationship between 
NAS/NAC and Carrier A and restrict Carrier A operations as described 
in the LOA
•If the proposed LOA is rejected, management may still acquire Carrier 
A.  The acquisition would be subject to the terms of the CBA and 
related letters of agreement, including the possibility that Saltchuk 
would place Carrier A outside of NAS control and operate it without 
the restrictions set forth in the LOA 

--- PAGE BREAK ---

The Status of Carrier A
•Under the proposed LOA, Carrier A is an Affiliate of NAS
•Carrier A and its Pilots are exempted from the CBA if NAS, 
NAC and Carrier A satisfy certain restrictions set forth in the 
proposed LOA
•If NAS, NAC and/or Carrier A violate the specified restrictions 
in the proposed LOA, the LOA contains agreed upon 
remedies, including but not limited to the loss of the 
exemption from the CBA. 

--- PAGE BREAK ---

Negotiated Restrictions on Carrier A 
•Carrier A currently conducts cargo and passenger operations under 
Part 135
•The LOA prohibits Carrier A from operating under or acquiring a Part 
121 certificate or conducting operations other than under Part 135
•The LOA prohibits Carrier A from operating aircraft with a maximum 
payload capacity of 7,500 lbs.  The LOA grandfathers two specific 
aircraft currently operated by Carrier A, which may carry up to a 
maximum of 7,500 lbs. of cargo.
•LOA prohibits Carrier A from acquiring or establishing another air 
carrier.

--- PAGE BREAK ---

Agreed Upon Remedies for Violations 
•If Carrier A violates these restrictions (or if Carrier A is moved by 
Saltchuk to another division (not NAS) after the acquisition), the 
LOA provides for multiple agreed upon remedies including:
•Injunctive relief 
•Cease and desist 
•Liquidated damages of $100,000.00 per day
•Recalls and prohibition on furloughs, downgrades, loss of 
compensation and slowing of the growth of the Pilot group
•Loss of CBA exemption
•Union triggered negotiations over amendments to the CBA 
with a requirement that both sides will request a 
proffer/release from mediation 

--- PAGE BREAK ---

Pay Protections Under the LOA
•Carrier A operations are not restricted geographically
•However, NAC cannot subcontract, consign, convey, transfer, assign or divert flying to 
Carrier A, and Carrier A shall not otherwise perform flying that NAC could perform, if 
doing so directly or indirectly causes a reduction of revenue flying conducted by NAC.
•A loss of revenue flying is determined by the amount of Block Time PCH paid to pilots 
operating in the specific geographic market.
•NAC must make payments to pilots equal to the loss of Block Time PCH compensation 
(separately calculated based on average Captain and First Officer rates for pilots 
Domiciled in the affected geographic marketplace and aircraft type) during which the 
proven violation occurred, and restore the reduced flying caused directly or indirectly by 
Carrier A conducting the flying, in addition to any other appropriate remedy.
•If NAC claims the reduced flying cannot be restored to NAC as a result of customer 
requirements or because the flying no longer exists in the NAC system, the burden is on 
NAC to prove the claim.  The Company must provide information to the Union in support 
of such a claim.

MOU #2 : Positive Contac t Responsibilit ies. 
Dear Mr. Macri : 
This letter  will confi rm our mutual understan ding and a greement regarding  the proper 
application of subsections 13.H. and 15.D. when  changes to a Pilot’s schedule is 
changed, including the notification of a Reserve Pilot’s RAP and Rest Period Times . 
Each Pilot is required to provide their primary contact telephone number to the  
Company , including any changes or updates . Unless otherwise mutually agreed upon 
by the Pilot and Crew Scheduling , this telephone number shall  be the only means of 
creating  “Positive C ontact ” with a Pilot  when Crew Scheduling changes a Pilot’s  
scheduled Assignment (s) in his Line . When  a Pilot’s  primary contact telephone 
number becomes  unusable, it shall be his responsi bility to inform the C rew scheduling, 
prior to his next scheduled Assignment, of his alternate contact method. The Pilot may, 
at his sole discretion, provide the Company with alternate contact numbers and/or 
emails that m ay be used, but unless the Pilot no tifies the Company of a change in his 
primary contact number or email address, the Company shall only be obligated to 
utilize the previous primary contact method that the Pilot  has authorized. As a courtesy 
after making Positive Contact with the Pilot, the  Company may follow up the call with 
an email that covers the content of their conversation. In the event a telephone number 
cannot be used to make  Positive Contact with a  Pilot, alternate means may be mutually 
arranged between the Pilot and Crew Scheduling, such as the  use of an email address 
or another approved PCD , in order  to assure that  Positive Contact  is made . 
The Company and the Union mutually agree to adopt the above -mentioned processes 
to assure that Positive Contact between the Pilot and the Company is accomplished.

MOU #3 : Reassignment to Trip Pairings contain ing R2 Reserve Assignment s. 
Dear Mr. Macri : 
This letter  will confi rm our mutual understan ding and a greement regarding  the 
approved creation of  Multi -Day Trip Pairings  contai ning Flight and/or Deadhead 
Segments and R2 RAP’s (e.g., current ANC Trip Pairings that are scheduled for 
multi -day RON’s in LRD or HNL; current multi -day HNL Trip Pairings for the B767 
Pilot’s in MIA). , as provided  subsections 14.D.1. and  14.D.2.a. , and t he approved  
assignment  of such Trip Pairings to a Pilot who has a block of scheduled R1 or R2 
RAP’s in his Line or has been Reassigned to R4 Duty.  It is recognized  that 
historically  the Company has created  such Trip Pairings , as it has  provided mutual 
bene fits for the Co mpany , as well as the  NAC Pilot s. 
Therefore,  it is mutually  under stood and agreed  that the Company may continue to 
create these  multi -day Trip  Pairings and Pilots who are scheduled to perform  a 
block of Reserve Assignments may be assigned to perform such Trip Pairings  and 
shall be done so in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement .  
Should the Company utilize a Pilot performing a R1 Reserve Availability Period 
(RAP) for  such a multi -day Trip Pairing  that contain R2 RAP’s, they shal l attempt to 
notify a Pilot as early  as possible when assigning  such Trip Pairing to the Pilot.  
Should  the EXCO in the future determine that such Trip P airings may have been 
assigned outside of the provisions of this Agreement, the Company shall schedul e 
a meeting date with the EXCO Chairman, or his designee, within fourteen (14) Days 
of his initial contact to the Company, for the purpose of discussing their current 
practices for assigning such Trip Pairings and suggested improvements. Any such 
discussio ns shall not circumvent or become an alternative to the Grievance or 
System Board of Adjustment processes, as provided in Sections 19 and 20, but 
may be used for the purpose of potentially remedying a previously submitted 
griev ance by a Pilot(s) or the EXC O.

Northern Air Cargo , Inc.

MOU #4 : Reassignment to a new  type of Reserve Assignment.  
Dear Mr. Macri : 
This letter  will confi rm our mutual understan ding and a greement regarding  a Pilot 
who is  Reassigned  to another type of Reserve Assignment when  already  
schedul ed to a Reserve Assignment  in his Line . As provided in 14.J Reassignment, 
the Collective Bargaining  Agree ment (CBA) provides limitations and restrictions to 
Reassigning a Pilot who is scheduled to pe rform a  Trip Pairing  in his Line. The 
parties agree that it is the intent ion of  subsection 14.J., to prohibit Crew 
Scheduling from Reassigning a  Pilot who is performing or is  scheduled to 
perform  a Trip Pairing  to a Reserve Assignment. Furthermore, it is also agree d 
that the intent of this subsection is to prohibit Crew Scheduling from Reassigning a 
Pilot who  “is performing ” any Assignment to a Reserve Assignment, except  when 
Reassigned to  a R1 or R2 Reserve Availability Period (RAP)  and is  Reassigned  to 
a R4 RAP.  The parties also agreed that it was not the intent  to prohibit Crew 
Scheduling from  Reassigning a Pilot  who has a  scheduled  Reserve Assignment  in 
his Line , to another Type of Reserve Assignment, so long as it is not during the 
same Duty Perio d and it must and must be  on the same  scheduled  Day(s)  as his 
previously scheduled Reserve Assignments . When a Pilot , who is currently 
performing  a Reserve Assignment , is notified that he is to be  Reassign ed in the 
future  to another type of Reserve Assignment , he must be provided applicable 
Rest prior to beginning his new Reserve Assignment.   
In Subsection 3.F., Reserve Pay provides  the direction  as to how a Pilot  with a  
scheduled Reserve Assignment  in his Line is paid when he is subsequently 
assig ned to  perform “a Trip Pairing ” or “other Company -Directed Assignment s.” 
Section 2, Definitions provides a clear understanding of the definitions for 
“Company -Directed Assignments ” and “Assignments” . Under the definition of an 
Assignment, it references an example  of an Assignment  as a “Reserve Period.”  
Subsection ’s 14.J.5.a. and 14.J.5.b. also references specific instances when a Pilot 
who is scheduled to perform a Reserve Assignment may be Reassigned back into 
a previously scheduled  Reserv e Assignment. In this in stance, the  parties  intended 
that a  Reassignment  from a scheduled Reserve Assignment to another type of 
Reserve Assignment was legal, subject to  the provision’s stated  restrictions and 
limitations .  
When Crew Scheduling  Reassigns a Pilot to another  type  of Reserve Assignment, 
the following Restrictions and Limitations shall apply.    
(1) W hen Reassigning a Pilot to  R1 RAP’s, Crew Scheduling  shall immediately
schedul e the Pilot  for one (1) Day Off in every seven (7) Days  in his Line and provide
him with t he applicable DOT’s and Duty Off Times for each  within each new R1 RAP.
(2) A Pilot who is Reassigned to a new type of Reserve Assignment shall be
scheduled to perform that new type of Reserve Assignment on the same Days as his
originally scheduled Reserve Assignments in his Line.DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708
Page 322 of 333

--- PAGE BREAK ---

(3)If Crew Scheduling intends to  notify a Pilo t who is performing or is scheduled to
perform a RAP  that he is to be Reassigned to another Type of Re serve
Assignment  in the future  and there are more than two Pilots who are avail able for
such Reassignment , they shall Reassign the Pilot utilizing the First -In/First -Out
(FIFO) provisions, as provided in Section 15 (Reserve) , and
(4)(4) As provided in 14.E. 12., Minimum Net Reserve Compliment, Crew Planning
shall, to the extent possible, construct in each Domicile a minimum number of
Reserve Lines that contain R1 RAP’s to cover each  Day in the Month.
(5)A Pilot who has R1 RAP’s  in his Line  shall not have them  Reassigned to another  type
of Reserve Assignments.

Schedulin g provides the Pilot with  at least  a forty-eight (48)  hour notice  in advance of
the DOT of his first scheduled R1 RAP, the Pilot shall  be responsible for his own Travel
to his Domicile . When the notification for such Reassignment is less than  forty-eight
(48)hours, the Company shall  then provide him Deadhead Travel  to his Domicile.
(8)When the Reassignment in paragraph (6) involves  a R3  Reserve Assignment(s)  to
an R1 RAP(s)  or R3 Reserve Assignments to an  R2 RAPs , the Pilot shall be provided

continue throughout his time in Domicile when such Trip Pairing contains two (2)
or fewer consecutive R1 RAP’s and/or 2 Days of Flight Segments . When, under
the same conditions the Trip Pairing is scheduled with three (3) or more
consecutive R1 RAP’s and/or Flight Segments, the Trip Rig for that Trip Pairing
shall end upon arriving in Domicile and a new Trip Rig will not begin until he is
assigne d to his next Trip Pairing  If the Pilot is initially scheduled to a  Tr ip Pairing

(13) When Crew Scheduling is intending to Reassign a Pi lot, who is  performing or is
scheduled to perform a RAP or Reserve Assignment in his Line and there are more
than two Pilots who may be Reassigned, they shall Reassign the Pilot utiliz ing the
First-In/First -Out (FIFO) provisions, as provided in Section 15 (Reserve). When it is
prior to the beginning of the Month and that Month’s applicable FIFO List , they shall
Reassign the more junior Pilot  first.
Therefore,  it is mutually  under stood and agreed  that the Company may assign a Pilot 
to another type of Reserve Assignment when performing or scheduled to perform a  
different  Reserve Assignment, as provided for in this MOU. It is further understood that 
such Reassignments  shall be accomplished, as provided for in this Agreement.  
Should  the EXCO in the futu re determine that Crew Planning/Crew Scheduling has 
potentially violated the provisions of this Agreement when assigning Reserve 
Assignments to a Pilot who is performing or is scheduled to p erform a Reserve 
Assignment, the Company shall schedule a meeting date with the EXCO Chairman, or 
his d esignee, within fourteen (14) Days of his initial contact to the Company, for the 
purpose of discussing their current practices for assigning such Trip Pairings and 
suggested improvements. Any such discussions shall not circumvent or become an 
alternative to the Grievance or System Board of Adjustment processes, as provided in 
Sections 19 and 20, but may be used for the purpose of potentially remedying a 
previously submitted grievance by a Pilot(s) or the EXCO.

MOU #5: Pay Implications  to Lines  during the Monthly Bid Process . 
Dear Mr. Macri : 
This letter  will confi rm our mutual understan ding and a greement regardin g pay 
applications as it relates to a Pilot’s  Line PCH value and how any additional PCH he earns 
in the Month is applied to the MPG  (65 PCH), as provided in subsection 3.D . Under 
Subsection 3.N. (Month ly Cumulative PCH), it assumes  that each Line  at the beg inning 
of each Month  has a PCH value at or above the MPG .  As provided  in 14.E.7., “All Lines 
shall be valued at no less than MPG, as provided in Section 3 (Compensation), and 
constructed to no more than ninety -five (95) PC H.” Except as provided elsewhere  in this 
Agreement , it is understood  that all Regular, Composite and Reserve  Lines that are 
constructed by the Company  shall have a PCH value or above the MPG  (65 PCH) . 
Further more, if  the Company con structs a Line that has an actual PCH value that is less 
than the MPG, that Line shall have a published  Initial  Line PCH value o f 65 PCH  and any 
PCH increases or decreases  resulting from the Monthly Integration procedures, as 
provided in subsection 14.E., shall be applied to a Line’s actual PCH value it is higher 
than the MPG and 65 PCH, when a  Line has a PCH value that is equal to, or less than 
the MPG.    
As understood in the paragraph above, a Regular Line may realize a decrease in its Initial 
Line PCH value during the Integration Procedures. As provided  in 14.G., it also states 
that a  Pilot who is awarded a Regular  Line may participate in SAP. When a Regular 
Line’s  PCH value falls below the MPG,  as a result of the application of  one or more of the 
Month ly Integration Procedures, a Pilot  shall initiate SA P with “super -seniority” status  for 
the purpose of recovering his Line PCH  back  to the MPG . Once his Regular  Line value 
has been  recovered, he shall revert to his proper Seniority status in his Fleet Type  and 
Domicile and may continue to participate in SA P. If after SAP,  a Pilot does  not participate  
to the extent necessary in order to  recover his  Regular  Line PCH  back to the MPG , 
subsection 14.G.4. directs  the Company to assign available Trip Pairings from Open Time 
and/or Reserve Assignme nts (in Open Time or not)  to any Days Off  on his  Regular  Line 
that were  original  Workdays on  his Initial Line award . Once the MPG has been reached, 
the Company shall cease to add additional Trip Pairings and/or Reserve Ass ignments . 
If, as provided in this  paragraph, the Company is unable recover a Pilot’s  Regular  Line 
PCH to the MPG, the parties agree that his individual MPG for the Month shall be adjusted 
to the PCH value o n his Final Line Award  and all additional PCH tha t is earned in the 
Month shall be in addition to that adjusted MPG value.  
The parties agree that it is important to have  an effective  SAP process. Therefore, the 
Company agrees, prior to constructing the Initial Lines,  to follow  the Monthly  PCH “hold -
back” parameters  in each Domicile  for each Fleet Type:  
(1)Three hundred ( 300) PCH  or less , the allowable maximum of fifteen  percent (15%) .
(2)More than  three hundred (300) and five hundred (500) PCH – holdback of at least
twelve (12%) perc ent.
(3) Mor e than five hundred (500) PCH and six Hundred (600) PCH – at least nine percent
(9%) holdback.DocuSign Envelope ID: 7A46D395-CB86-4F80-B6A9-EE3300CB9708

(4) More than six hundred (600) PCH and seven hundred (700) PCH – at least seven
percent (7%) holdback.
(5)More than seven Hundred (700) PCH and nine hundred ( 900) PCH – at least six
percent (6%)  holdback.
(6)More than eight hundred (800) PCH and one thousand (1000) PCH – at least five
percent (5%) holdback.
(7)More than one thousand (1000) and one thousand -two hundred (1200) PCH – at least
4 percent (4% ).
(8)Above one  thousand -two hundred (1200) PCH – the minimum of three percent (3%)
As provided in this Agreement, the parties agree  that a Pilot who has been  assigned or 
awarded  a Composite and  Reserve Line  cannot participate in SAP. As a result of this 
restriction, a ll Composite and Reserve Lines after the Final Bid Award shall have a PCH 
value at or above  the MPG  and all additional PCH earned in the Month shall be paid in 
addition to the MPG , except , when  a Pilo t is awarded or assigned to a Reserve or 
Composite Line a nd he  utilizes his awarded Vacation in a Month, but does not have the 
required number of PTO Days in his PTO Bank  in order  to cover the PCH  requirements 
inside his Vacation Block , he shall  utilize hi s remaining  PTO Days  from his PTO Bank 
and if his Line PC H falls below sixty -five PCH (MPG), his Line MPG shall be adjusted  to 
his Final Bid Line PCH and all additional earned PCH in the Month shall be paid in addition 
to that adjusted MPG .   
When the Scheduling Committee agrees to utilize the Secondary Bid Pro cess in a 
Domicile, as provided in subsection 14.H.1., and after the Integration Process  a Pilot’s 
Line PCH falls below the MPG, the Company  shall utilize the available provisions , as 
provided in subsection 14.H. to recover his PCH up to the MPG. In all cases under the 
Secondary Bid Process, since a Pilot is unable to utilize the SAP Process, his  MPG shall 
be 65 PCH, as provided in subsection 3.D.,  and all additional PCH that is earned in the 
Month shall be in addition to his MPG.  
It is understood by the  parties that  such provisions in Section 14 is intended to give the 
Pilot and the Company the ability to recover a Pilot’s Line PCH up to the MPG. It is also 
understood that the Company may elect to build Lines that are less than the MPG, but 
subsection 14.E.7. protects such Line value to the MPG. I f, after the SAP Process or 
after the Secondary Bid Process , the Company elects not to utilize the  available  
provisions  in Section 14 to recover a Pilot’s Line PCH  to the MPG ,  this inaction  by the 
Company  shall not negatively affect the Pilot’s Line value  and the Line PCH shall begin 
the Month at the MPG, so long as no other further actions are taken by the Pilot that 
would increase or decrease his Line PCH, as provided for in this Agreement.    
This MOU shall no t circumvent or become an alternative to the Grievance or System 
Board of Adjustment processes, as provided in Sections 19 and 20, but is intended to  
be used for the purpose of potentially remedying any submitted grievance by a Pilot(s) 
or the EXCO.

MOU # 6: Company Paid Move Entitlements. 
Dear Mr. Macri : 
This letter  will confi rm our mutual understan ding and a greement regarding  the 
timeliness of a Company Paid Move . Once  a Pilot is awarded a Vacancy , as 
provided in  Subsection 6.F.2.  and completes his Training for the awarded Vacancy 
and/or assumes his Vacancy in a different Domicile, he shall qualify for a Company 
Paid Move, when he meets the requirements in subsection 6.F .2.  
Subsection 18.F. provid es the Company to notify the Pilo ts with  a minimum amount 
of information  for each Vacancy  or Displacement  Bid. One requirement is to provide 
an Effective Date for each  Vacancy  or Displacement in each Bid. In the definition of 
an “Effective Date, ” as provid ed in Section 2, Definitions , it states :  “(b) the date on 
which a Vacancy becomes an active Position within the Company and/or Domicile .” 
Furthermore, in subsection 12.A.3., it defines  what is a Training  Event  and OE is 
the final phase of each Training Ev ent. Once his Training Event has been 
successfully completed and he assumes his new Vacancy on its Effective Date or 
afterwards, if a Pilot’s Training has exceeded the published Effective Date, it now  
becomes an “ Active Position” in that Domicile  and at su ch time, he shall qualify for 
his Company Paid Move, including the start of his one (1) year clock.   
When  Training is not required, if a Pilot is awarded a Position in a different 
Domicile,  due to a Vacancy or Displacement Bid,  he shall be  entitled to  a Company 
Paid Move , if he qualifies for such move, as provided in subsection 6.F.2.  At the 
time he assumes his new Position from a new Vacancy or Displacement Award,  i.e., 
the Effective Date of the Vacancy, he shall have one  (1) Year to initi ate his 
Company Paid Move.   
For all Domiciles that were  “New Domicile s” at the DOS of this Agreement, the 
Pilots who were awarded Vacancies in these New Vacancies shall have one (1) 
Year, beginning on  October 1, 2018,  to initiate his Company Paid Move .   
Should  a dispute arise regarding the applicability or definition of any of the 
provisions within this MOU, the EXCO and the Company shall convene  a meeting 
within fourteen (14) Days . Any such discussions shall not circumvent or become an 
alternative to the Grieva nce or System Board of Adjustment processes, as provided 
in Sections 19 and 20, but may be used for the purpose of  successfully resolving 
such dispute or to remedy a  previously submitted grievance by a Pilot(s) or the 
EXCO.

MOU # 8: Pay  When Changing Positions . 
Dear Mr. Macri : 
This letter  will confi rm our mutual understan ding and a greement regarding  the Pay 
when Changing Positions. Subsection 3.W. states: “If the Company delays sending a 
Pilot to his  Training for sixty (60) Days or less and a more junior Pilot who was awarded 
the same Position in the same or latter Displacement or Vacancy Bid  begins receiving 
his higher Hourly Pay Rate for that Position, as provided in this Section 3, the delayed 
Pilot shall receive his higher Hourly Pay Rate for that Position,  as provided in Section 18 
(Filling of Vacancies).  If any such Training delay exceeds sixty (60) Days, the more 
senior Pilot shall begin receiving the  higher Hourly Pay Rate beginning on the six ty-first 
(61st) Day after his Assigned Training Date. ”   
The parties understand there will be operational circumstances that w ould warrant the 
bypass ing of a Senior Pilot for a more junior Pilot  from the same Va cancy Bid Award or 
when  the more junior Pilo t is from a subsequent Bid  and a more Senior Pilot has yet to 
start his Training and/or occupy his newly awarded Vacancy  from a previous Bid .  
The parties also agree to the intent of subsection 3.W: when  the Company bypasses a 
senior Pilot (s) for a more j unior Pilo t(s), as soon as the more junior Pilot begins to be 
paid his higher pay rate for the Position , on a “man -for-man- basis,” the most senior 
Pilot who has been bypasses shall begin to be paid his higher Rate of Pay for the same 
Position.   
Should  a dispute arise regarding the intention or application of the provisions within 
this MOU, the EXCO and the Company shall convene a meeting within fourteen (14)

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE JOINT  PILOT’S GROUP  
IBT LOCAL 986/959/ 769 
 
 
 
 
August 24, 2021  
To:  Northern Air Cargo Pilot Group  
 
From: Northern Air Cargo Pilots  Executive Committee  
 
Subject:  MOU #11 – Volunteer Pilot Availability (VPA) Assignment Time Limitations  
 
To All Pilots,  
 
Several months ago, a pilot inquired about submitting a grievance because other pilots were awarded 
Open Time Assignments ahead of his already documented VPA request.  While the merits of the pilot’s 
argument were outside the s cope of the CBA, it did bring to light the need to assign an international trip 
pairing sooner than 48 hours prior, similar to the Reserve Assignment procedures.   
 
Under the current language both the domestic and international trips may only be assigned within 24 
hours of its DOT.  
 
Section 14.N.7.  “A Pilot on the VPA List shall be available to be contacted by Crew Scheduling for an 
Assignment in accordance with his VPA request limitations within forty -eight (48) hours prior to the date 
and time he has volunteered . If he is currently performing an Assignment for the Company when Crew 
Scheduling attempts to contact him, he shall contact Crew Scheduling at the end of that Assignment.”  
 
As a result, the NAC ExCo and IBT successfully negotiated a new Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
with the Company.  The MOU #11, Volunteer Pilot Availability (VPA) Assignment Time Limitations , allow s 
Pilots on the VPA list to be assigned international trip pa iring as early as 96 hours prior to the scheduled 
Duty On Time (DOT) for the Assignment .  The MOU #11 is attached for your review, and shall be added to 
the appropriate  MOU Section  of our CBA.  
 
Fraternally Yours,  
 
 
Captain David Dyas  
Northern Air Cargo Executive Committee  Chairman
